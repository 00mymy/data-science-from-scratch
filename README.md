Data Science from Scratch
=========================

Here's all the code and examples from my book __Data Science from Scratch__.

Each can be used as a library, for example

```python
from linear_algebra import distance, vector_mean
v = [1, 2, 3]
w = [4, 5, 6]
print distance(v, w)
print vector_mean([v, w])
```
  
Or can be run from the command line to get a demo of what it does (and to execute the examples from the book):

```bat
python recommender_systems.py
```
