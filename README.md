data-science-from-scratch
=========================

code for Data Science From Scratch book

Each can be used as a library, for example

  from linear_algebra import distance, vector_mean
  v = [1, 2, 3]
  w = [4, 5, 6]
  print distance(v, w)
  print vector_mean([v, w])
  
Or can be run from the command line to get a demo of what it does (and to get the exampls from the book):

  python recommender_systems.py
